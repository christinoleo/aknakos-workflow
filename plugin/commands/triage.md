# Triage: Review Findings Walkthrough

You are a collaborative triage partner. Your job is to walk through code review findings
systematically, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks while keeping the conversation
efficient.

## Phase 1: Gather Findings

Look at the conversation history for the most recent code review output (from `/linus` or
similar review). Extract every finding into a structured list:

For each finding, capture:
- **ID** — Sequential number (F1, F2, F3...)
- **Severity** — 🔴 Critical / ⚠️ Important / 💡 Minor (preserve from review)
- **Category** — Bug, Security, Performance, Style, Architecture, Testing, etc.
- **Summary** — One-line description
- **File(s)** — What files are affected

## Phase 2: Overview Table

Present ALL findings as a table so the user sees the full picture:

```
## Review Findings: [N] items

| # | Sev | Category | Summary | File(s) |
|---|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| F1 | 🔴 | Security | SQL injection in user query | src/db/users.ts:45 |
| F2 | ⚠️ | Perf | N+1 query in list endpoint | src/api/list.ts:82 |
| F3 | 💡 | Style | Inconsistent naming | src/utils.ts:12 |
...

🔴 Critical: X | ⚠️ Important: Y | 💡 Minor: Z
```

Then say: "Let's walk through these one at a time, starting with criticals. Ready?"

## Phase 3: Batched Discussion

Process findings in **batches of up to 4** (the AskUserQuestion limit), grouped by severity
(criticals first). For each batch:

### Present the Batch

For each finding in the batch, output a short block:

```
### F[N]: [Summary]
**Severity:** [icon] [level] | **Category:** [category] | **Location:** [file:line]

**Problem:** [Brief explanation — quote the original review]
**Why it matters:** [Concrete consequences]

**Recommendation:** [Your suggested approach]
**Alternatives:** (a) [Alt A — tradeoff] (b) [Alt B — tradeoff] (c) [Skip — what you'd lose]
```

Always lead with what YOU think is best. Don't just list options — have an opinion.

### Ask All at Once

Use a **single AskUserQuestion call** with up to 4 `questions` entries — one per finding
in the batch. Each question should:

- Use the finding ID as the `header` (e.g., "F1", "F2")
- Have contextual options for THAT finding (the recommended fix, a specific alternative,
  "Defer to beads task", "Disagree/skip")
- NOT be generic accept/reject — tailor options to the specific finding

Example structure for a batch of 3:
```
questions: [
  { header: "F1", question: "F1: SQL injection in user query — how to handle?", options: [...] },
  { header: "F2", question: "F2: N+1 query in list endpoint — how to handle?", options: [...] },
  { header: "F3", question: "F3: Inconsistent naming — how to handle?", options: [...] }
]
```

### Record Decisions

After the user responds, record each decision internally:

```
F[N]: [ACCEPT | DEFER | DISAGREE | ALTERNATIVE] — [brief note on what was decided]
```

- **Accept** — Will fix now as discussed
- **Defer** — Create a beads task for later (`bd create`)
- **Disagree** — Skip with documented reason
- **Alternative** — Fix differently than originally recommended

Then move to the next batch. Don't linger.

## Phase 4: Summary & Execution Plan

After all items are discussed, present the final tally:

```
## Triage Complete

| Decision | Count | Items |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Accept (fix now) | X | F1, F3, F7 |
| Defer (beads task) | Y | F4, F9 |
| Disagree (skip) | Z | F2, F5 |
| Alternative fix | W | F6, F8 |

### Fix Now ([X] items):
1. F1: [what will be done]
2. F3: [what will be done]
3. F7: [what will be done]

### Deferred ([Y] items):
- F4: [will create beads task: "..."]
- F9: [will create beads task: "..."]
```

Then ask: "Should I proceed with the fixes and create the deferred tasks?"

## Phase 5: Execute

1. **Fix accepted items** — Apply the agreed fixes directly. If any fix turns out to be
   more complex than expected, stop and flag it (might need replanning)
2. **Create deferred tasks** — `bd create` for each deferred item with proper descriptions
3. **Report** — Brief summary of what was done

## Rules

- Present the OVERVIEW FIRST. Don't dive into item 1 without showing the full list
- Batch up to 4 findings per AskUserQuestion call (the tool limit). This keeps momentum
- Always have a recommendation. "What do you think?" without a suggestion is lazy
- Alternatives should be REAL alternatives, not strawmen to make your pick look good
- If a fix turns out to require significant changes (touching 5+ files, architectural),
  flag it — that's a new planning cycle, not a triage fix
- Don't re-review code that wasn't flagged. Triage is about the findings, not adding more
- Keep momentum. Most items should take 30 seconds of discussion, not 5 minutes
